Thoughts and Feedback:
This was a frustrating two days. I think we started out okay, by sketching out several ideas for layouts, but then we stumbled a little over the requirement to identify SASS elements to be used.

We did use the 7-1 pattern (though didn't wind up having elements in all 7) and I think it might have helped to at least write out what major elements would go in each so there wasn't so much confusion on this as we went.

My partner really wanted to use media queries for all responsive elements. I wanted to make more use of the Bootstrap grid to place elements of the page. This was hard. In the end we wound up splitting up the work so she was writing media queries to move the major components of the page and I was starting to work on the elements that went within those. This in retrospect was not a good approach - lesson learned.

I still think using a Bootstrap grid or at least making use of the looping example would have been the better approach to what we were trying to do, but we should have found a better compromise. As it was we wound up having an aha moment right at the end of the day and were able to salvage the page, but it took a lot of pain to get to that point. We definitely had some communication issues that I tried to work on, but I don't feel like I was that successful.

Today I want to try a simpler version of the page, one that makes better use of a framework for things like the nav bar and a slideshow, so that fewer things have to be custom built. I'm not sure yet how I want to create the grid yet - maybe going back to the Monday exercises.

MIXIN
Used to create custom "brand" colors to be reused across a variety of elements.

OPERATORS
Used to create custom element sizes

EXTEND/INHERITANCE
Used to create certain base styles for a series of similar elements, in this case the styling of the three parts of our footer

NESTING
We intended to use nesting for some elements of the nav bar but we never got that built out.

PARTIALS
We definitely made use of partials to organize our SCSS.
